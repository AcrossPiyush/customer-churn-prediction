Customer Churn Prediction with Python & SQL
Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using Machine Learning (Random Forest) and SQL for data storage. It involves EDA, feature engineering, and creating visualizations to analyze customer behavior and improve retention strategies.
Technologies Used
â€¢	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
â€¢	SQL (For data storage and retrieval)
â€¢	Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab (For running the project)
